    <h2>Parent's Review</h2>
    <h3>
        My initial impressions are that they are really good. For the initial classes, which my daughter is still in, its completely image based. <br>
        This means the child doesn’t have to write the code but drag and drop the code that’s already written.
This gives an easy entrance into coding world without having to worry about writing textual bases coding.<br>

The coding classes are more of game based with point system to encourage the kids to attempt.<br>
 I haven’t found any fault yet and hope I don’t find any in the near future.
    </h3>
    <h3>
    White hat junior is the best platform for the kids to learn coding logic.<br>

      Curriculum is totally based on Pragmatic approach, which makes it unique , so kids will learn by doing.<br>
       As per the curriculum, for the kids of age 9 years onwards, Students will lead towards the text based coding.<br>
        Fast pace of changing Technology is the reality, this course helps to prepare them for future, <br>
